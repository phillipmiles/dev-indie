# This is a test title

This is an example file where I would be writing and editing the content of a blog post completly ignoring **how** it will be rendered in the final app. This is just about content only.

I’ve told bits and pieces of my story on different podcasts. Now feels like an appropriate time to write down the parts that were most memorable to me.

## Oh look, a heading 2

Every person’s story is unique and not directly reproducible. I’ve benefited immensely from the privilege of being born in an upper middle class family and looking like a typical coder stereotype. People took chances on me. Still, I hope that sharing my story can be helpful to compare our experiences. Even if our circumstances are too different, at least you might find some of it entertaining.

I was born in Russia and I finished the high school there in 2009. In Russia, higher education is free if you do well enough at tests. I tried my chances with a few colleges. I was particularly hoping to get into one college whose students often won programming competitions (which I thought was cool at the time).

Shim and Khor are both Asian American creators from racial diasporas; their lived experiences are intrinsic to their work. Sharing that experience — albeit with different lives and stories — had an impact on Field Guide and their other works, too.

“While my [personal heritage] might not come up explicitly in our work, this is stuff that always informs the undercurrents of any art that I make, certainly,” Shim said. “And to work with someone where I didn’t have to explain something, or where I could see that resonance was present for them as well, was absolutely revelatory.”
