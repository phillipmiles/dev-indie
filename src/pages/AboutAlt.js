                  development has been my game for a while now. It's where I've

                one idea. In fact on both accounts it won't be as I'd like to be
                producing a variety of ideas quickly. This will allow me to
                experiement more freely and prevent me from investing too much
                time into bad ideas.

                It does have to involve technology though. Technology is so
                incredibly powerful in it's ability to scale and provide value
                to many people and with the state of technology today it's
                feasible for a single developer to accomplish this.

                Dev Indie is a site I created as a place to share my journey and
                of what I learn whilst attempting to make web and mobile apps.

                I hope to show what cool things a motivated solo developer and
                designer can create by themselves with the right skills and to
                I'd like to be transparent about my process

                I expected to learn a lot about design, development and
                marketing throughout the process and thought a place to share
                this knowledge would be valuable with others who may be hoping
                to do something similar.

                In order to allow others get the most out of this site, I want
                to be brutally honest and show transparency into how the apps
                are performing. What the usage numbers are, what the running
                costs are, how much (if any) revenue is coming in.

                I have made to maybe suggest what works and doesn&apos;t work in
                building successful apps.
